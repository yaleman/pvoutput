# Example usage

Here's a quick code example:

```python
    from pvoutput import PVOutput
    import json
    apikey = 'aaaaaabbbbbbccccccddddddeeeeeeffffffgggg'
    systemid = 12345
    pvo = PVOutput(apikey=apikey, systemid=systemid)
    print(json.dumps(pvo.check_rate_limit(), indent=2))
```
Will give you output like this:
```
    {
        "X-Rate-Limit-Remaining": "271",
        "X-Rate-Limit-Limit": "300",
        "X-Rate-Limit-Reset": "1570597200"
    }
```

There are more example code snippets in the [examples](examples/) directory.

# Installing

## Prod-ish usage

`python -m pip install pvoutput` to install from pypi

## Dev Install Things

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip flit
python -m flit install
```

# Input validation

This is handled by the `pvoutput.base.PVOutputBase.validate_data` function.

It expects the input data and a dict of configuration parameters, which are described in the table below:

| Field name | Required | Valid Types | Description |
| --- |  --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | `Any` | This is a python type object to match against the field type. |
| `required` | No | `bool` | This defines if the field is required. |
| `description` | No | `Any` | This is currently unused, but typically holds the description from the PVOutput API Docs |
| `donation_required` | No | `bool` | If set to true, and the user's not donated, it'll throw a `DonationRequired` exception if the user tries to use functionality that requires them to have donated. It's a whole thing. |
| `maxlen` | No | `int` | Maximum length of the field. ie. `if len(field) > maxlen: raise ValueError` |
| `maxval` | No | `int` | Maximum value of the field. |
| `minval` | No | `int` | Minimum value of the field. |
| `additional_validators` | No | `List[function]` | A list of functions to run against the field, which should throw exceptions if something's wrong. |

An example configuration

```
"date_val": {
    "required": True,
    "description": "Date",
    "type": date,
    "donation_required": False,
    "additional_validators" : [
        validate_delete_status_date
    ]
}
```
